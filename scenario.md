**Recruitment Scenario – Software Engineer**

**Introduction**

This document contains a scenario that will be used as part of the interview process with Cushon.

You should spend as much time as you need to feel comfortable. The goal here is not to solicit free labour, but rather to have an informed discussion regarding how you might approach a real scenario, here in the Engineering Team at Cushon.

You are free to document or present this in any manner that you choose. The scenario definition is not exhaustive, and you may have to make some assumptions regarding our internal systems and processes.

The follow-up session will discuss your approaches to the problem and aspects you feel are important. Please submit anything you would like to present at least one business day before the scheduled interview.

While this is not a timed exercise, we would expect you to spend between four to six hours completing it. This time is provided for you so that you can plan your time; there will be no expectation to let us know how long you have taken.

At the interview, there will be a session where we will ask you some questions about your solution.

**About Cushon**

Cushon is a fintech provider of workplace savings and pensions; we like to look at ourselves as a technology company that happens to operate in financial services.

Through a combination of web and native applications, Cushon offers pensions and investment services to direct members, employers, and via intermediaries and payroll providers.

Across our web and mobile apps, Cushon has a full end-to-end pension offering, allowing members to accumulate and access their pension benefits based on scheme and regulatory rules.

We are also proud to offer offline services, which allow members to carry out any servicing of their accounts by contacting the Cushon operations team.

Cushon offers a Master Trust pension and is regulated as such.

**Scenario
Description**

Cushon already offers ISAs and pensions to employees of companies (employers) who have an existing arrangement with Cushon.

Cushon would like to be able to offer ISA investments to retail (direct) customers who are not associated with an employer.

Cushon would like to keep the functionality for retail ISA customers separate from its employer-based offering where practical.

When customers invest into a Cushon ISA, they should be able to select a single fund from a list of available options.

Currently, they will be restricted to selecting a single fund; however, in the future, we anticipate allowing selection of multiple options.

Once the customer’s selection has been made, they should also be able to provide details of the amount they would like to invest.

Given that the customer has both made their selection and provided the amount, the system should record these values and allow them to be queried at a later date.

Specific Use Case

Consider a customer who wishes to deposit £25,000 into a Cushon ISA, all into the Cushon Equities Fund.

**Assignment**

Please provide your solution to the above scenario in whatever form you feel is appropriate, using your preferred tools.

You should spend the amount of time you feel is appropriate to showcase your abilities and knowledge.

At the interview, you should be prepared to discuss:

What you have done and why.

The specific decisions you made about your solution.

Any assumptions you have made in the solution you have presented.

Any enhancements you considered but decided not to cover.
